## JavaScript Projects

This repository contains projects that demonstrate basic functionality of JavaScript.


This repo consists of the following projects:
- **Number Guesser**: An interactive web game, where the user can play against a computer to guess a number between 0-9, with score history.
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors x99**: An interactive web game, where the user can play the traditional game of rock paper scissors against another player or the computer, best of 3 rounds.
But, there's a catch, you can also set attack points to each move and in case of a tie, whoever has more attack points wins.
