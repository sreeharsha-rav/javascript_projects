This repository contains projects that demonstrate functionality of JavaScript on Front-End and the Back-End.


### Projects

This repo consists of the following projects:
- [**Number Guesser**](https://github.com/sreeharsha-rav/javascript_projects/tree/main/number_guesser): An interactive number guessing web game.

### Requirements
Need to have Node.js on terminal to run the projects. 
To check if you have Node.js and npm installed, type these in your terminal:
