## Mixed Messages
<!-- Project Description -->
The Mixed Messages is a simple JavaScript program that generates random silly excuses by combining different pieces of data. Each time the program is run or the "Generate Excuse" button is clicked, it produces a new and unique message composed of three parts: a problem, an action, and a location. This project serves as a fun and educational exercise in JavaScript programming and can be customized to generate various types of random messages.
