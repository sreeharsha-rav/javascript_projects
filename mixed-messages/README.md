## Mixed Messages
<!-- Project Description -->
The Mixed Messages is a simple JavaScript program that generates random silly excuses by combining different pieces of data. Each time the program is run or the "Generate Excuse" button is clicked, it produces a new and unique message composed of three parts: a problem, an action, and a location. This project serves as a fun and educational exercise in JavaScript programming and can be customized to generate various types of random messages.

### Installation and Usage
<!-- How to install and run the project? -->
To run the Message Generator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Click the "Generate Message" button to generate and display a random message on the web page.

You can also customize the messages by modifying the data arrays in the script.js file. Add or edit greetings, prepositions, and locations to create different types of random messages.
