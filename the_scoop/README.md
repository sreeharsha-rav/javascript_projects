### Installation and Usage
<!-- How to install and run the project? -->
Code will run in the browser instead of the terminal. To use it:

2. From the root project directory, run on terminal:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    to install all necessary dependencies. (You will just need to do this once)
3. Start the server on your terminal:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
4. Open **index.html** on your local browser, to interact with the web app.
5. To exit/end, press '**ctrl+c**' on the terminal, close the browser.
